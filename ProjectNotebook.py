# # Personality Quiz -- Determining Age Based on Food Preferences
# ## Heather Patterson
# 

# # Project Description
# This project focuses on the use of three different functions to formulate a personality quiz. The quiz will produce five questions in which there are four options for each. The user will select an option for each question and then the quiz will produce a result that tells the user their age based on their food preferences. The final question will ask the user if the guess was correct. This quiz also utilizes the 'sleep' function as part of the 'time' module to progressively introduce information.

# # Extra Credit (optional)

# I have no prior experience with python, only experience using excel, tableau...etc. So this project was a very steep learning curve for me. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting errors and figuring out ways I could consolidate code, make it more readable, and user friendly. Although the code/concept isn't overly complex I still spent a significant and substantial amount of time on this project. I learned a great deal from this course and look forward to applying it to classes and projects in the future! :)
